# App

For the second part of the assignment, we would like you to implement a simple app using the Foursquare Places API.
We've already added some code / functionality, but some parts may still be missing in order for it to work.

## Setup
Add your Foursquare client ID and secret to `local.gradle`. See `local.gradle.example` for details.
Tip: You can verify your credentials with `src/test/java/com/adyen/android/assignment/PlacesUnitTest.kt`


Ideas:
- Show a list of venues around the user's current location.
- Implement filter / search functionality.
